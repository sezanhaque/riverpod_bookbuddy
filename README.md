## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/bookbuddy.git
    cd bookbuddy

    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**

    ```
    flutter pub get

    ```

3.  **Run a Specific Flavor**

    ### BookBuddy

    uses the flutter_flavor package to manage flavors based on subject types.

    ### From VS Code

    Open .vscode/launch.json and run any configuration:

    ```
    {
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "configurations": [
        {
        "name": "Book Buddy Fiction",
        "program": "lib/main.dart",
        "request": "launch",
        "type": "dart"
        },
        {
        "name": "Book Buddy Science",
        "program": "lib/main_science.dart",
        "request": "launch",
        "type": "dart"
        }
    ]
    }
    ```

    Or from terminal:

    ```
    flutter run
    flutter run -t lib/main_science.dart
    ```

## State Management Approach

We are using Riverpod for state management and dependency injection, along with an MVVM structure.
